**This tool is a knife. Do not use it if you don't have any backup, or if you don't know what it does. Backup and restore tool avialble in plugin.**

**SPECIAL PLUGIN**. Such a plugin is difficult to create and to maintain. If you understand WordPress, you probably know why. This plugin does its best to help you. Learn how to use it and you will get awesome results.

**DASHBOARD**. The files detected as not used will be listed in a specific dashboard. At this point, it will be up to you to delete them.
